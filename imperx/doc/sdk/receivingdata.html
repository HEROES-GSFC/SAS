<h1><a class="anchor" id="receivingdata">Receiving Data </a></h1><h1>Receiving Data from a GigE Vision Transmitter</h1>
<p>A GigE Vision device (transmitter) transmits blocks of data (such as images) over a network using the GigE Vision Streaming Protocol (GVSP).</p>
<p>The eBUS SDK provides a means of receiving those packets as they come over the network and assembling them into an area of memory that is accessible to the calling application.</p>
<p>The software component that receives and assembles streaming packets into a usable block of memory is commonly referred to as a data receiver.</p>
<p>A filter driver called eBUS Universal Pro is bundled with the eBUS SDK and can optionally be applied to a network adapter in order to maximize streaming performance (bypassing the standard network stack to achieve lower CPU usage and better data throughput).</p>
<p>Depending on whether a filter driver is applied or not, the data receiver may exist in kernel space or user space.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_base.html" title="Base class defining functionality inherited by PvStream and PvStreamRaw.">PvStreamBase</a> (and consequently its child classes <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_raw.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties accessible...">PvStreamRaw</a> and <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties dynamically...">PvStream</a>) provides an interface for configuring and receiving data from the data receiver.</p>
<p>Note that there are two different classes that can be instantiated to receive blocks (such as images or raw data) from a GigE Vision transmitter.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_raw.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties accessible...">PvStreamRaw</a> provides a raw C++ interface to all the <a href="streamparameters.html">data receiver properties</a>.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_pv_stream.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties dynamically...">PvStream</a> provides access to a <a class="el" href="class_pv_gen_parameter_array.html" title="GenICam feature array.">PvGenParameterArray</a> containing all the <a href="streamparameters.html">data receiver properties</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_raw.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties accessible...">PvStreamRaw</a> and <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream.html" title="Receive data from a GigE Vision transmitter (data receiver properties dynamically...">PvStream</a> inherit from <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_base.html" title="Base class defining functionality inherited by PvStream and PvStreamRaw.">PvStreamBase</a> which contains common functionality for opening a connection to the data receiver and obtaining data from it.</p>
<p>The process of receiving data from a GigE Vision transmitter involves queuing buffers into the data receiver ensuring that there are always buffers available for the incoming data. A <a class="el" href="class_pv_stream_base.html" title="Base class defining functionality inherited by PvStream and PvStreamRaw.">PvStreamBase</a> object is normally used in conjunction with a <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html" title="Helper class for receiving data from a GigE Vision transmitter.">PvPipeline</a> object which helps manage the process of allocating and pushing buffers into the data receiver as needed.</p>
<p>Opening a <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html" title="Helper class for receiving data from a GigE Vision transmitter.">PvPipeline</a> object allocates a pool of available buffers (configurable by calling <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html#a87f3a47f56b191392537179e35a20d75" title="Set the number of buffers owned and used by the PvPipeline.">PvPipeline::SetBufferCount</a> and <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html#aba577c2678fea237b1d6d92d49189aee" title="Set the optimal size of buffers being queued into the data receiver.">PvPipeline::SetBufferSize</a>) and starts a thread that continually feeds buffers into the data receiver. Each time a new block (such as an image or raw data) becomes available, its associated buffer is placed in a queue of available buffers that can be retrieved by calling <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html#a3b18c44b205acc99c2448788c46e4b17" title="Retrieve the next acquired block.">PvPipeline::RetrieveNextBuffer</a>.</p>
<p>If the calling application cannot retrieve buffers at the rate that data is arriving, buffers are silently dropped. To obtain a count of dropped buffers, refer to the <a href="streamparameters.html#PipelineBlocksDropped">PipelineBlocksDropped</a> property accessible from the stream.</p>
<p>To control a GigE Vision device (i.e. tell it when and where to transmit data), the eBUS SDK provides a class called <a class="el" href="class_pv_device.html" title="Connect, configure and control a GigE Vision device.">PvDevice</a>. For a complete working sample that connects to a GigE Vision device, opens a stream and tells the device when and where to begin streaming, refer to the sample entitled PvPipelineSample.</p>
<p>In some cases, it may be desirable for an application to manage the process of allocating and pushing buffers into the data receiver without making use of a <a class="el" href="class_pv_pipeline.html" title="Helper class for receiving data from a GigE Vision transmitter.">PvPipeline</a> object. For complete working samples that incorporate this concept, refer to PvStreamSample and PvCustomPipelineSample. </p>
